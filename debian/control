Description: LTTng analyses (Python 3)
 This repository contains various scripts to extract monitoring data and
 metrics from LTTng kernel traces.
 .
 As opposed to other diagnostic or monitoring solutions, this approach is
 designed to allow users to record their system's activity with a low
 overhead, wait for a problem to occur and then diagnose its cause offline.
 .
 This solution allows the user to target hard to find problems and dig until
 the root cause is found.
